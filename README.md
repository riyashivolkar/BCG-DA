# BCG Internship - PowerCo Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility that supplies small and medium-sized enterprises. Due to increased competition in the energy market, PowerCo is experiencing a rise in customer churn, leading them to seek BCG's expertise in diagnosing the issue and providing strategic recommendations to retain customers.

## Learning
- How to interpret the business context and understand client concerns.
- How to break down the problem before beginning data analysis.
- How to determine relevant client data for analysis.
- Techniques to investigate the client's problem using data science.
- How to summarize findings in an executive email to the Associate Director.


### Step 1: Understanding the Business Context
- Learn about PowerCo's challenges and the competitive energy market.
- Define the problem statement: identifying the factors contributing to customer churn.

### Step 2: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
- Analyze PowerCo’s client data using Python.
- Perform data cleaning and processing.
- Engineer new features from price and client data to improve churn prediction.

### Step 3: Building a Predictive Model
- Implement a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict customer churn.
- Train the model using historical data to distinguish between customers who stay and those who leave.
- Evaluate the model using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess performance.

### Step 4: Communicating Insights
- Summarize findings and key insights in an executive email to the Associate Director.
- Provide actionable recommendations for PowerCo to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis & Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Data Analysis Report** – A Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering steps.
2. **Churn Prediction Model** – A trained Random Forest Classifier with evaluation metrics.
3. **Executive Summary** – A structured email summarizing findings and recommendations for PowerCo.

## Conclusion
This project will help PowerCo better understand customer churn patterns and implement strategies to improve retention. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data insights, we aim to provide actionable solutions to minimize customer losses and maintain PowerCo’s competitive edge in the energy market.
